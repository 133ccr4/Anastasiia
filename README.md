# Web project
  
Development Sequence:
Regarding whether to start with the backend or frontend, it's generally a good practice to begin with a basic backend structure to define how data will flow within the application. However, a parallel approach can also be effective, where basic versions of both are developed in tandem. This allows for early testing of the end-to-end functionality.

ToDos and Project Breakdown:

# Project Initialization:
~~- Define project scope and requirements.~~
~~- Set up version control using Git.~~

# Database Design:
- Set up SQL database schema for users, body types, styles, and product inventories.
- Include tables for user preferences, body measurements, and budget constraints.

# Backend Development (Python + Framework):
- Implement authentication and user profile management.
- Develop the body type test logic and result computation.
- Create the style preference questionnaire.
- Write the recommendation algorithm.
- Build APIs for frontend communication.

# Data Collection and Organization:
- Collect fashion item data through web scraping/APIs/manual entry.
- Structure the data into the database with proper relations.

# Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
- Design and implement the user interface for tests and style selection.
- Use AJAX to interact with backend APIs for dynamic content loading.
- Display recommended fashion items based on user data.

# Testing:
- Write unit tests for backend logic.
- Conduct UI/UX testing with potential users.
- Validate data consistency and performance of recommendation engine.

# Iterative Development and Feedback:
- Release the application for beta testing.
- Collect user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.

# Launch and Marketing:
- Prepare marketing materials and launch the application.
- Monitor user interactions and gather data for further improvements.


# Key Considerations:

Legal and Compliance: Ensure that data collection through web scraping is compliant with legal standards and website terms of service.
User Privacy: Implement strong privacy measures to protect user data.
Scalability: Design the backend to handle an increasing number of users and data points efficiently.
Usability: Ensure that the user interface is intuitive and accessible.
In terms of prioritization, you would want to start with setting up the backend framework and database as they are the foundation of your application. After these are in place, you can proceed with frontend development, where you would be able to immediately see how the application will interact with the backend in real-time.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and each phase will have its detailed tasks that need to be addressed in order to progress to the next phase of development.
